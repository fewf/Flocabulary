If player = X then there are exactly 9 choose 5 legal inputs (because X moves first, X can win with minimum 3 X's, or tie with maximum 5 X's.

If player = X then there are exactly 9 choose 4 legal inputs (because X moves first, O can win with minimum 3 O's, or tie with maximum 4 O's.

9 choose 5 is 15,120 permutations
9 choose 4 is  3,024 permutations

Therefore, cover all cases of legal player input with 15,120 + 3,024 = 18,144 test cases.

Each case is printed on one line in file named "player_test_data_pre1.txt".

To create "player_test_data.txt" run the following from any sh/csh/bash/etc. shell:

  tr ' ' '\n' < player_test_data_pre1.txt > player_test_data.txt

If running this many test cases is time-prohibitive, pick a random (or pseudorandom) collection of lines from the player_test_data_pre1.txt (before running "tr") and delete the rest.
